# Code-Free-Projects
Here you can find some of my non-coding projects!

Most stem from my undergraduate studies and extracurricular involvements at the University of Ottawa before my involvement in Data Science. These are more broadly meant to reflect a general curiosity and scientific inquiry on life as we know it!

Cheers,

Luka Vukovic
