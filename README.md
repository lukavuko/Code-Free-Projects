# Code-Free-Projects
Here you can find some of my non-coding projects meant to reflect my general curiosity on life as we know it.

These were put together during my undergraduate studies at the University of Ottawa.

1. Catalyst Articles // For a fun Student Science Journal club
2. Honours Project // Under supervision of Dr. Emilio Alarcon @ The BioEngineering and Therapeutic Solutions Lab
3. An essay on alternative approaches to the drug war // For a first year essay writing class
4. Model UN Position Paper // For one of my favourite Social Science electives
5. Nanozole Therapeutics Proposal // For my favourite topic in 4th year: Nanomedicine
6. A research proposal on what LSD does to the neuronal gene expression // For my fourth year seminar 

Enjoy if you're interested!
